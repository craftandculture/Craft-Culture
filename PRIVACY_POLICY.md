## 1. Introduction

Craft & Culture Index ("Craft & Culture," "we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting the personal data of individuals with whom we deal.

## 2. Scope and Application

This Policy applies to all personal data we process in the United Arab Emirates (onshore) and also to any processing of personal data of UAE residents (even if some processing occurs outside the UAE) in line with the extraterritorial scope of the PDPL.

If you are located in a UAE free zone jurisdiction (for example DIFC Data Protection Commissioner's Office / ADGM Data Protection Regulator) whose own data-protection regime applies, you may need to review additional or alternative privacy policies.

We collect only the personal data necessary ("data minimisation") and use it only for the purposes communicated to you ("purpose limitation") in line with PDPL principles.

## 5. Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Data

We do not sell or trade your personal data. We may, however, share data in the following circumstances:

- **Corporate transactions** – in the event of a merger, acquisition or sale of our business/assets, your personal data may be transferred to the successor entity, subject to confidentiality and compliance.

We ensure that any sharing／transfer of personal data is done in compliance with the PDPL's rules on cross-border transfers (see Section 9).

## 6. Data Security & Retention
