### BREAKING CHANGES

* Lead time is now managed through admin panel instead of hardcoded values

Added database schema and API:

- New /platform/admin/settings page with settings form
- Editable inputs for lead time min/max with live preview
- Settings persisted to database

Updated calculator and quotation builder:
- B2BCalculator fetches lead time from settings API
- QuotesForm banner displays dynamic lead time values
- Falls back to 14-21 days if settings not configured
- Excel export includes dynamic lead time values

Technical changes:
- Added settings schema to database with timestamps and RLS
- Created settingsGetController and settingsUpdateController
- Created input validation schemas with Zod
- Used React Query for fetching settings in components
- Removed hardcoded lead time state from calculator

* Margin calculation logic changed from simple addition to uplift model

Changed margin calculation approach:
- Landed Price = In-Bond + Import Duty + Transfer Cost
- Margin applied as uplift: Landed / (1 - margin%) for percentage margin
- Fixed margin: Landed + fixed amount
- VAT (5%) calculated on price after margin
- Final price = Price after margin + VAT

Updated files:
- B2BCalculatorProductBreakdown: New calculation functions for landed price, margin, and VAT
- calculateB2BQuote: Updated formula and added landedPrice, priceAfterMargin, and vat fields
- B2BCalculatorBreakdown: Added VAT display line
- exportB2BQuoteToExcel: Added Landed Price and VAT rows

### BREAKING CHANGES

* Lead time is now managed through admin panel instead of hardcoded values

Added database schema and API:
- Created settings table with key-value storage
- Added tRPC endpoints for getting/updating settings (admin.settings.get, admin.settings.update)
- Get endpoint is public, update requires admin role

Created admin settings page:
- New /platform/admin/settings page with settings form
- Editable inputs for lead time min/max with live preview
- Settings persisted to database

Updated calculator and quotation builder:
- B2BCalculator fetches lead time from settings API
- QuotesForm banner displays dynamic lead time values
- Falls back to 14-21 days if settings not configured
- Excel export includes dynamic lead time values

Technical changes:
- Added settings schema to database with timestamps and RLS
- Created settingsGetController and settingsUpdateController
- Created input validation schemas with Zod
- Used React Query for fetching settings in components
- Removed hardcoded lead time state from calculator

* Margin calculation logic changed from simple addition to uplift model

Changed margin calculation approach:
- Landed Price = In-Bond + Import Duty + Transfer Cost
- Margin applied as uplift: Landed / (1 - margin%) for percentage margin
- Fixed margin: Landed + fixed amount
- VAT (5%) calculated on price after margin
- Final price = Price after margin + VAT

Updated files:
- B2BCalculatorProductBreakdown: New calculation functions for landed price, margin, and VAT
- calculateB2BQuote: Updated formula and added landedPrice, priceAfterMargin, and vat fields
- B2BCalculatorBreakdown: Added VAT display line
- exportB2BQuoteToExcel: Added Landed Price and VAT rows

### BREAKING CHANGES

* Lead time is now managed through admin panel instead of hardcoded values

- Editable inputs for lead time min/max with live preview
- Settings persisted to database

Updated calculator and quotation builder:
- B2BCalculator fetches lead time from settings API
- QuotesForm banner displays dynamic lead time values
- Falls back to 14-21 days if settings not configured
- Excel export includes dynamic lead time values

Technical changes:
- Added settings schema to database with timestamps and RLS
- Created settingsGetController and settingsUpdateController
- Created input validation schemas with Zod
- Used React Query for fetching settings in components
- Removed hardcoded lead time state from calculator

* Margin calculation logic changed from simple addition to uplift model

Changed margin calculation approach:
- Landed Price = In-Bond + Import Duty + Transfer Cost
- Margin applied as uplift: Landed / (1 - margin%) for percentage margin
- Fixed margin: Landed + fixed amount
- VAT (5%) calculated on price after margin
- Final price = Price after margin + VAT

Updated files:
- B2BCalculatorProductBreakdown: New calculation functions for landed price, margin, and VAT
- calculateB2BQuote: Updated formula and added landedPrice, priceAfterMargin, and vat fields
- B2BCalculatorBreakdown: Added VAT display line
- exportB2BQuoteToExcel: Added Landed Price and VAT rows

### BREAKING CHANGES

* Margin calculation logic changed from simple addition to uplift model

Changed margin calculation approach:
- Landed Price = In-Bond + Import Duty + Transfer Cost
- Margin applied as uplift: Landed / (1 - margin%) for percentage margin
- Fixed margin: Landed + fixed amount
- VAT (5%) calculated on price after margin
- Final price = Price after margin + VAT

Updated files:
- B2BCalculatorProductBreakdown: New calculation functions for landed price, margin, and VAT
- calculateB2BQuote: Updated formula and added landedPrice, priceAfterMargin, and vat fields
- B2BCalculatorBreakdown: Added VAT display line
- exportB2BQuoteToExcel: Added Landed Price and VAT rows

### BREAKING CHANGES

* Margin calculation logic changed from simple addition to uplift model

Changed margin calculation approach:
- Landed Price = In-Bond + Import Duty + Transfer Cost
- Margin applied as uplift: Landed / (1 - margin%) for percentage margin
- Fixed margin: Landed + fixed amount
- VAT (5%) calculated on price after margin
- Final price = Price after margin + VAT

Updated files:
- B2BCalculatorProductBreakdown: New calculation functions for landed price, margin, and VAT
- calculateB2BQuote: Updated formula and added landedPrice, priceAfterMargin, and vat fields
- B2BCalculatorBreakdown: Added VAT display line
- exportB2BQuoteToExcel: Added Landed Price and VAT rows

### BREAKING CHANGES

* Margin calculation logic changed from simple addition to uplift model

Changed margin calculation approach:
- Landed Price = In-Bond + Import Duty + Transfer Cost
- Margin applied as uplift: Landed / (1 - margin%) for percentage margin
- Fixed margin: Landed + fixed amount
- VAT (5%) calculated on price after margin
- Final price = Price after margin + VAT

Updated files:
- B2BCalculatorProductBreakdown: New calculation functions for landed price, margin, and VAT
- calculateB2BQuote: Updated formula and added landedPrice, priceAfterMargin, and vat fields
- B2BCalculatorBreakdown: Added VAT display line
- exportB2BQuoteToExcel: Added Landed Price and VAT rows

### BREAKING CHANGES

* Margin calculation logic changed from simple addition to uplift model

Changed margin calculation approach:

- Fixed margin: Landed + fixed amount
- VAT (5%) calculated on price after margin
- Final price = Price after margin + VAT

Updated files:
- B2BCalculatorProductBreakdown: New calculation functions for landed price, margin, and VAT
- calculateB2BQuote: Updated formula and added landedPrice, priceAfterMargin, and vat fields
- B2BCalculatorBreakdown: Added VAT display line
- exportB2BQuoteToExcel: Added Landed Price and VAT rows

### BREAKING CHANGES

* Margin calculation logic changed from simple addition to uplift model

Changed margin calculation approach:
- Landed Price = In-Bond + Import Duty + Transfer Cost
- Margin applied as uplift: Landed / (1 - margin%) for percentage margin
- Fixed margin: Landed + fixed amount
- VAT (5%) calculated on price after margin
- Final price = Price after margin + VAT

Updated files:
- B2BCalculatorProductBreakdown: New calculation functions for landed price, margin, and VAT
- calculateB2BQuote: Updated formula and added landedPrice, priceAfterMargin, and vat fields
- B2BCalculatorBreakdown: Added VAT display line
- exportB2BQuoteToExcel: Added Landed Price and VAT rows
