## 6. Known Issues & Technical Debt

### 6.1 TypeScript Errors in Tests
**Priority:** Low
**Impact:** None on production
**Files Affected:** 6 test files
**Recommended Action:** Schedule cleanup in next sprint

**Specific Issues:**
1. Missing `beforeEach` type imports (Vitest types)
2. Case sensitivity in test fixtures ("CultX" vs "cultx")
3. Strict null checks for DOM element access
4. NODE_ENV immutability in test environment

### 6.2 Recent Reverted Changes
**Context:** Commits c644032 through e779fb4 introduced TypeScript errors
**Action Taken:** Reverted to commit 8aead53 (stable state)
**Lost Features:** 
- Database migration for lastViewedActivityAt field
- Activity notification mark-as-read functionality
- Improved prebuild script
**Recommendation:** Re-implement these features with proper type safety

---

## 7. Performance Metrics

### 7.1 Build Performance
```
Test Suite: 7.40s total
- Transform: 4.55s
- Setup: 6.60s
- Collect: 9.77s
- Execution: 17.52s
- Environment: 16.17s
```

### 7.2 HTTP Response Times
```
Homepage redirect: 0.061s
Sign-in page: <1s (estimated)
```

---

## 8. Recommendations

### 8.1 Immediate Actions
✅ **COMPLETE** - None required. System is stable.

### 8.2 Short-term (Next 1-2 Weeks)
1. Fix TypeScript errors in test files
   - Add proper Vitest type imports
   - Standardize test fixture data
   - Add null checks for DOM queries

2. Re-implement reverted features with proper types
   - Add lastViewedActivityAt field with complete type definitions
   - Implement mark-as-read with type-safe API
   - Add comprehensive tests for new features

### 8.3 Long-term (Next Sprint)
1. Consider adding E2E tests with Playwright/Cypress
2. Implement visual regression testing
3. Add performance monitoring (Web Vitals)
4. Set up automated accessibility testing

---

## 9. Deployment History

### Recent Deployments
```
1. e779fb4 - REVERTED (TypeScript errors)
   "fix: improve build reliability and distinguish notification bells"
   
2. cc5f8c5 - REVERTED (TypeScript errors)  
   "chore(release): 1.72.0 [skip ci]"
   
3. c644032 - REVERTED (Incomplete migration)

   Status: Stable, all tests passing
```

---

## 10. Conclusion

**Overall Health: ✅ EXCELLENT**

The Craft & Culture platform is in a stable, production-ready state:
- All 335 unit tests passing
- Zero production code errors
- Deployment successful and verified
- Application accessible and functional
- Security headers in place
- Critical business logic validated

The 39 TypeScript errors in test files are minor technical debt that do not impact production functionality or user experience. The application is safe for continued use and development.
